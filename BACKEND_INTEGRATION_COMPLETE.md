   - **Bullet Points:** 
     - "Milk"
     - "Eggs"
     - "Bread"
3. Click "Save Task"
4. Wait for geocoding and task creation
5. The task should appear in the list and on the map

### 3. **Test Task Operations**

#### Mark as Complete:

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Configuration
- **Backend URL:** `https://2866sc2ucfrrp8nf5fvke56cet4smzdj.app.specular.dev`
- **Configured in:** `app.json` → `expo.extra.backendUrl`
- **Read by:** `utils/api.ts` → `Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.backendUrl`

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in → Better Auth creates session
2. Session token stored in SecureStore (native) or localStorage (web)
3. All API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Token auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
5. On sign out, token is cleared from storage

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Optimistic Updates:** UI updates immediately, reverts on error
- **User Feedback:** All errors shown in custom modals
- **Logging:** All API calls logged with `[API]` prefix
- **Graceful Degradation:** App continues to work with cached data if API fails

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Testing:
1. **Create a test account** using the sign-up flow
2. **Create multiple tasks** with real addresses
3. **Test on different platforms** (web, iOS, Android)
4. **Test offline behavior** (turn off network)
5. **Test location permissions** on physical devices

### For Production:
1. **Add OAuth credentials** to the backend (Google, Apple)
2. **Configure email verification** (if required)
3. **Set up push notifications** for production
4. **Test background location tracking** on physical devices
5. **Add error tracking** (e.g., Sentry)

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No Raw Fetch Calls:** All API calls go through `utils/api.ts` wrapper
2. **Bearer Token Auth:** Tokens stored securely and included in all authenticated requests
3. **Auth Bootstrap:** App checks session on mount before rendering navigation
4. **Custom Modals:** No Alert.alert() for web compatibility
5. **Optimistic Updates:** UI updates immediately for better UX
6. **Platform-Specific Storage:** SecureStore (native) vs localStorage (web)
7. **Auto Token Refresh:** Session refreshed every 5 minutes to prevent expiration

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Authentication token not found"
**Solution:** User needs to sign in. The app will automatically redirect to /auth.

### Issue: "Failed to load tasks"
**Solution:** Check network connection and backend availability. Tasks will load on retry.

### Issue: Geocoding fails
**Solution:** Ensure the address is valid. Try a more specific address (include city, state).

### Issue: Location permissions denied
**Solution:** User must grant location permissions in device settings for proximity notifications to work.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console logs (look for `[API]` prefix)
2. Verify the backend is running at the configured URL
3. Ensure you're signed in (check Profile screen)
4. Try signing out and back in to refresh the session
